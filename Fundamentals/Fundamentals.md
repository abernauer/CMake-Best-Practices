# Introduction

CMake is a set of tools covering everything from setting up a build through to producing a package ready for distribution. Supporting a wide range of platforms, tools and languages.


The first stage takes a generic project description and generates platform-specific project files using a developer's standard build tool of choice (e.g. make, Xcode, Visual Studio, etc.). This initial stage can be classified as the setup stage where Project File Generation takes place. Also following under the CMake tools are CTest and CPack for testing and packaging respectively.
